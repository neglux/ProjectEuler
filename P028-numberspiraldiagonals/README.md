## Number spiral diagonals

---

<p>Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:</p>

```
                21 22 23 24 25
                20  7  8  9 10
                19  6  1  2 11
                18  5  4  3 12
                17 16 15 14 13
```

<p>It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.</p>
<p>What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?</p>
